# nuzlocke_choicer
A way to choose you pokemon on pokemon scarlet and violet for each rout, for a nuzlocke challenge.

I made a script to help my encounters on the new pokemon games, is a simple python prompt interface that a made in a hour or two to prepare for my nuzzlocke. I find this way better than just runing blind, because every pokemon on the route will be a possible enconter not just the one's that spawn in the front.

On this script every pokemon has the same chance to be a encounter, not ideal, but can't find a good list with the chances of spawn that was simple to copy past.

The encounter areas was the one's that i find in pokemon wiki, if i miss areas locations that have a encounter plis let me now.

The list of pokemon off it area was taken from IGN and game8 website's. Was the better one's to copy paste the names.

Just something that i do for myself because cound't find something, so with you think you could do better, plis do and send to me XD.

If a find better material with the list off areas, possible enconters and spawn rate's, i will try to update the script.

With somoene has upgrade's or the material information better the one's that i use, please send me a spreadsheet from google docs and i coud try to use for a better scrip.

About runnig the script, is just a simple python program, it's not soo hard to find a tutorial to run this scripts, it's a basic lerning program level.

For remove the list of exclusives from the pokemonm edit the scrip and put a # on the version you don't have and remove # on the version you have. 
# Example com me running violet:
